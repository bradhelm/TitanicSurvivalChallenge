# TitanicSurvivalChallenge
This was my entry in Kaggle's Titanic Survival challenge.  I did perform some exploratory data analysis
in a Jupyter notebook on Kaggle, but I chose to refine my process at home on a PC with an nVidia GTX 1070
GPU.

This was as much a primer on programming python using NumPy and Pandas as it was about the final solution.
I had done some python coding years prior, but had not gone back to it for several years.  

I incorporated k-folds and metric scoring to determine which particular classifier out of a number of
pre-selected classifiers showed the most promise and then used that classifier to analyze and predict
the test data.
